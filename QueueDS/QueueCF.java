    "Both can be used to implement a queue, but ArrayDeque is generally faster and more
     memory-efficient because it's backed by a resizable array. LinkedList uses a doubly
     linked list, so it has more overhead. Also, ArrayDeque doesnâ€™t allow null elements, 
    while LinkedList does. So, for queue operations, ArrayDeque is usually preferred unless 
    I specifically need to store null or do frequent insertions/removals in the middle."*/
